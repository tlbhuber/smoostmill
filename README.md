Portfolio (HW2)

# Portfolio

The following Homework assignment is only the begining!  This brings to focus what we have learned in the first two weeks of the Bootcamp.  This also shows the use of code that I was not aware existed yet (until I researched).  This project contains the following:

    *ABOUT ME 
    
    *CONTACT ME
    
    *PORTFOLIO

Although the bio information, contact information, and portfolio sections are just placeholders right now, they will soon be completed.  They will not only show my journey throughout this course, but will show the unlimited potential I see.
